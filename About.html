						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>Thank you for your interest in Beyond: Editing and Writing Services. My name is Andy Malinski.</p>
					</header>
					<img src="images/Andy.jpg" alt="Andy Malinski" style="width: 25%; float: left; padding: 0% 5% 0% 0%;" class="image-right"/>
					<p style="width: 75%; float: left; text-indent: 2%;">I am a detail-oriented copy, content, and developmental editor and proofreader with four years of experience in grammatical correction, content revision, style guide adherence, detail polishing, writing coaching, and manuscript development. I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of accuracy, consistency, and clarity of voice.  I have worked with numerous novelists, memoirists, academics, professors, and creators of all kinds.  My work has included such genres as children’s fiction, memoirs, sweeping epic romances, LGBTQ erotica, cookbooks, and religious texts.  I have been privileged to work with people from various cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, and personal identities. I hold a Master’s of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri.</p>
					
					<p style="clear: right; text-indent: 2%;">I approach writing like a director and/or a cinematographer. Where is the camera swooping in? Where are the close-ups? When does the score swell in the background to enhance emotion? When is there silence? I learned a great deal from Robert McKee’s outstanding book “Story” in my approach to writing. I want stories—fiction and nonfiction — to read and feel cinematic in scope. I want to place the reader in the moment as much as possible, whether through the senses, wordplay, dialogue, or emotion. I intentionally want to provide a score or soundtrack to enhance the reading experience whenever it seems appropriate to have accompanying music, bringing the scene to life more fully.  (Don’t be surprised if I send you a Spotify playlist I come up with!)</p>
					
					<p>I consider my “theme song” to be Mannheim Steamroller’s piece entitled “Mere Image” from Fresh Aire III. The childlike melody, which is full of wonder and whimsy, weaves throughout the piece, even as it becomes more and more complex, even nearly forgotten as it evolves into “adulthood.” In the end, through reminders, rekindling, and reassurance, the melody quietly returns for a slow, beautiful, final refrain—a reminder that “I am always here.”</p>
